The first number is the RA followed by the Dec."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6BNjmYxKSelE","cellView":"form"},"source":["#@title input the RA and dec for the exoplanets mentioned above\n","Peg_b_RA = \"0\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","Peg_b_dec = \"0\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","K2_25b_RA = \"0\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","K2_25b_dec = \"0\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","GJ_1214b_RA = \"0\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","GJ_1214b_dec = \"0\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","\n","#use RA and Dec of the exoplants to create SkyCoord obejcts for each \n","Peg_ra_dec = Peg_b_RA + ' ' + Peg_b_dec\n","Peg_b = SkyCoord(Peg_ra_dec, unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg))\n","\n","K2_25b_ra_dec = K2_25b_RA + ' ' + K2_25b_dec\n","K2_25b = SkyCoord(K2_25b_ra_dec, unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg))\n","\n","GJ_1214b_ra_dec = GJ_1214b_RA + ' ' + GJ_1214b_dec\n","GJ_1214b = SkyCoord(GJ_1214b_ra_dec, unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg))\n","\n","print('You have successfully input the RA and Decs!')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J_DWDWaVwKUD"},"source":["##<u>*Step 8*</u> I would like to use the 2.4m telescope at MDM Observatory on Kitt Peak to observe all three of these stars/planets in December and at an airmass less than 1.5.
